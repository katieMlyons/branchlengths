branchlengths
=============
####A product of the Tree-For-All hackathon.

Our scripts can...

- Query the [Open Tree of Life](tree.opentreeoflife.org) for its source trees
- Allow the user to select a source tree that overlaps with their favorite taxa and contains branch lengths
- Exchange some taxa on the source tree to maximize overlap with the user's input taxa
- Get calibration points from other timetrees in the [Open Tree of Life](tree.opentreeoflife.org) and from the [Paleobiology Database](paleobiodb.org/navigator)
- Use [Congruify](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/geiger/docs/congruify.phylo) to return a timetree with the maximum number of taxa from the user's input!
