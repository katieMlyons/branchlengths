# Day 1

1.  Find out how many studies in OpenTree have branch lengths.
- 643 studies with branch length information
- 1155 trees across those 643 studies with branch length information

### Reasonable goals
1.  get source tree with branch lengths
2.  identify calibration information
3.  congruify (geiger?  arbor?)
4.  return information to OpenTree

### Fantasy goals
1.  get subtree from list of taxa
2.  identify calibration information (PBDB)
3.  obtain sequence data (phylomill? phylota?)
4.  align and estimate molecular clock
5.  return to OpenTree
